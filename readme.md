### Agu's portfolio!

Simple portfolio website to showcase some of my projects.

Getting some more Typescript and Tailwind practice as I buit it. Also, adding dark/light mode and doing multi-language were first timers for me, which made it quite interesting! Having context for both aspects, and having a json file with the text for each of the languages, therefore allowing the individual components to stay as clean and reusable as possible.

#### Some of the learnings

As I was exploring multi-language possibilities, investigating about dynamic and conditional imports in particular (so I could import the necessary json file for the selected language depending on route or context) made me land on React.lazy, dynamic imports and code splitting. Found these super interesting to think about, especially seeing how much control one actually has over the way things are bundled and how code is split and rendered to the user in chunks. I'll definitely start trying to take these into account now on my future projects, since performance and optimization are topics that wake up my curiosity.

#### Posts/thoughts/blog addition

re-structured page, included router and react memo. Why? To practice some backend concepts that I was learning, thought I'd incorporate them into an already working thing.
