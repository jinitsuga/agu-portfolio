### Agu's portfolio

##### Simple portfolio website to showcase some of my projects.

If you wanna clone or copy the project for whatever reason, just fork it, clone it to your pc, and `npm install` should take care of the rest!
Keep in mind: the implementations of both dark mode and languages is far from perfect. I didn't know any better at the time so I took the hard "still good to learn" route; I'd probably do it differently today.

Refactoring soonTM
