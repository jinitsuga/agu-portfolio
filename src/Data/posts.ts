    content: `Back when I had just started studying web development (a bit over a year ago), something that helped me tremendously was, after a study session, sitting down and talking/writing about the things I had been working with. 

      Considering the number of things a self taught person with no technical background has to learn… this helped me realize how writing stuff down really solidified a lot of concepts (though for me practice always comes first when it comes to understanding a concept). By writing I don’t necessarily mean a blog post, writing on a notebook or writing documentation, it can also be telling people about the exciting things you learned, or how difficult it was to get the hang of a concept or tool. This was mostly the case for me, having a few friends who have been developing for some time time now, I felt like the little kid who goes to their parents and shows them a drawing, super proud of what they’ve accomplished.
      
      In addition to that, I want to have a little corner where I can “save” things I’ve been excited about enough to write about them(mostly when it comes to programming), and maybe going back to them after some time, allowing me to see my own progress… sounds like a fun little idea. I intend to follow through with this, and the chances that literally no one will read this are high, but who cares, really, it the end it is for one self.
      
      Lastly, the ability to practice sharing longer trains of thought in English is always welcome. I’m super exposed to the language, and most of the things I consume are in English, and I speak English with a lot of the people on a daily basis, but maintaining and conveying a longer/more complex idea or concept is a completely different beast.`,

    name: "Backend/fullstack thoughts",
    content: `I had been dabbling in and out of the backend for a bit, until I decided to try a different resource that a friend had recommended, and I must confess that it completely changed my approach to learning it. I've been loving the new course, and I basically learned how to build an API in a day. 

      It has also helped me scratch the (annoying and a lot of the time pointless) itch of having to know the *WHY* and the *HOW* of everything.
      
      Having a deeper understanding of the backend, and of the communication between client—server feels really important, and it has already made me realize about a few concepts that I just assumed worked magically, or never knew why they didn’t work.
      
      Knowing the exact role that an API plays within a project, or the different ways of authenticating users are things that straight up just make you a better front-end dev, even if you’re not messing with the backend at all. 
      Finally, since I’m also about to jump into Next.js and the whole server components and SSR side of things, I’m sure having a better understanding of how fullstack apps work is gonna be of tremendous help.`,
